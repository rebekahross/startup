Features of my startup application

My application will include live chatting between users over calendar items. Individuals will be able to customize colors of calendar items. They can see a view of the week, month, or year. They can filter their calendar so that they look at assignments for specific classes, projects, or activities. They can make calendar items and share them with others.

What I learned while doing the Simon HTML project:

I learned that HTML can be a bit repetitive sometimes. However, it is very user friendly and not difficult to understand. I'm sure that there are more difficult aspects of HTML than what I was doing, but it seems like the basics of HTML are pretty simple to grasp. I learned that every attribute needs to be opened and closed which is similar to how functions need to have start and close brackets. I also learned that I can do minor styling with HTML, although I'm sure it's not nearly as effective as CSS.

What I learned while doing the Simon CSS project:

I learned that HTML and CSS work together to create an attractive website. Using Bootstrap, you can implement changes to the overall appearance of the website. Flex can be used to make sure that the website looks how you want it to on different sizes of browsers and devices. Overall, these are fairly user friendly and fun to experiment with.

What I learned from doing the Start Up Deliverable - HTML and CSS

I learned that the internet is a great tool to use when trying to learn more. I learned that when I don't know how to do something in HTML or CSS, there are many resources I can turn to. I learned how to make my pages connect through links. I learned how to use Bootstrap better. I tried to learn how to design a layout that would be intiuitive for a user

What I learned from doing the Simon Javascript

I think this is a pretty difficult concept. Javascript is difficult to understand and incorporate, but one thing I learned is to start small and work bigger from there. My code and implementation does not need to be perfect on the first run through or attempt, so I just need to get plugging along and making an effort to improve my code and understand what is happening in the code.

What I learned from the Startup Javascript
This was a pretty difficult activity for me. I think that I learned some valuable things though. I was able to learn about other libraries that are useful in writing my code. I learned how to make pop-up (modal) boxes using javascript, which is a cool feature. I learned that sometimes I try too hard to complicate things that really aren't that difficult.

What I learned from the Simon Service
I learned that service is a way to standardize things across the internet, so there is more uniformity and support. This is how different devices know how to connect the same way. I honestly have no idea how I'd implement this on my own though.
